Server Prepkit
==============

A method for me to quickly set up my servers.

Edit `install.sh`. Ensure you go over every configuration option, and run it!

This script is pretty personalised; and it might not be 100% what you need. But for me it does quite a bit of work for me.

With that said, this script is licensed under MIT, do with it as you'd like, but no warranties.
